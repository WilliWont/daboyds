# Boid Simulationüê¶
**Description**
This is a repository made for simulating flock-like behaviors, developed by Craig Reynolds. 
A boid is considered to be a single entity in a much larger flock of entities, with each following the three following rules: 
* **Alignment**:
Where each boid follows the general direction of other boids
* **Separation**:
Where each boid tries to avoid collisions with incoming boids
* **Cohesion**:
Where each boid group together with other boids

With these three rules, each boid can demonstrate a rather accurate interpretation of real, life-like behaviors of a flock of birds, school of fish or even a herd of cows.
